There might be multiple columns with same name. This redundancy occurs because data
is passed through multiple phases. Call, SMS, Location and Application probes
records a lots of metadata. I listed the columns that would be most useful.


GRAPH ONE 

Inner GraphRunningApplicationProbe.csv:
    duration: Duration of the application usage in seconds. 
    taskInfo_baseIntent_mComponent_mPackage: Name of the application being used
    timestamp: Time stamp of when the data was recorded
    app_name: Name of app used
    app_color: HEX value of app to be used in graph display 
    app_icon: id of app_icon to be used in viz

ScreenProbe.csv:
Only Screen on (screenOn = TRUE) is graphed. 
    id: Index of the row.
    device: Id of the device.
    screenOn: true or false - Is it screen-on or screen-off event

    mLatitude: Latitude.
    mLongitude: Longitude
    mProvider: Provider of the location data (Mobile Netowork, GPS).
    timestamp: Time stamp of when the location was recorded.
    location_id: unique id of the location (0 = no data, -1 = travel)
    location_color: HEX color value to be used in graph
    duration: length of time in the location


GRAPH THREE
Outgoing communications mapped to inner graph. 
Incoming communication mapped to outer graph. 

Outgoing communication from both csv files to be used to create inner graph. 
Incoming communication from both csv files to be used to create outer graph. 

SMSProbe.csv: 
    id: Index of the row.
    device: Id of the device.
    address: The address of the sender or receiver.
    date: The date the message was sent or received.
    timestamp: Time when call was made or received.

    _id: Id of the row for internal processing.
